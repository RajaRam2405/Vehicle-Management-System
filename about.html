It allows shop administrators to register vehicles, schedule and assign service tasks to mechanics, and keep track of ongoing and completed work. Mechanics can easily access their assigned jobs, update service statuses, and ensure smooth workflow from start to finish. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL on the XAMPP platform, the system helps reduce paperwork, avoid scheduling conflicts, and maintain detailed service history for each vehicle. This ensures faster service, better organization, and increased customer satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: center; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: DauphinPlain; font-size: 70px; line-height: 90px;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">
